    "  De acordo com seus próprios criadores, o 'matminer' é uma biblioteca para a mineração de dados sobre inúmeros materiais diferentes. la possui diversos recursos que possibilitam, por exemplo, que você explore dados de datasets desenvolvidos com objetivos específicos; que você  crie seu próprio dataset, que manipule features a fim de transformá-las em dados numéricos. Muitas ações são possíveis e recomendamos ler o artigo \"Matminer: An open source toolkit for materials data mining\" escrito por Ward, L., Dunn, A., Faghaninia, A., Zimmermann, N. E.
